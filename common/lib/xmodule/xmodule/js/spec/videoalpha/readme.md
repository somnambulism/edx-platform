Jasmine JavaScript tests status
-------------------------------

As of 22.07.2013, all the tests in this directory pass. To disable each of them, change the top level "describe(" to "xdescribe(".

PS: When you are running the tests in chrome locally, make sure that chrome is started
with the option "--allow-file-access-from-files".
